Although this is the final installment of this series, I still keep reading and want to come back. I am not disappoint. The characters are well developed and everything like the cliffhanger with a certain destructive prophecy is thoroughly out of imagine. As a a meaningful resolution, the series wrapped up without major tragedy and with a few interesting twists and turns. Wonderful adventures and friendships forge with what seems like enemies. I am sad the series are over but the arc leaves it open for further wonderful adventures. I can hardly wait for and wonderful adventures. Highly recommended for fans of the fantasy genre. Well done and fantastic.
