This book is an intense story about a young woman Katie. She searches for answers as to what really happened that last summer at the lake with her father and her friend Lulu, trying to figure out whether her father unjustly went to prison for allegedly raping her best friend. Katie wanted to believe that her father was perfect and honestly was in her eyes because so much was hidden from her. The fact that Lulu gave into Katie father just because she liked him or she wanted him to love her like he loved her best friend. The disillusion of grownups being perfect and realizing your parents are not all knowing, and may even be flawed. The development of a friendship and the betrayal of trust by a family member portrayed are an example of today society. The story is written in clear prose and builds wounds or suspense artfully. It is also very deep and thought provoking, taken from real life. I enjoyed the unpredictable plot, the authentic characters, the setting, the great conflict and poof, nicely wrapped up and making you bounce and forth, which is a plus. It brought me straight back to my teenage years, just like the confusion or heartbreaking in childhood one goes through, relating readers in different ways. The author tied up the loose ends and did not leave you wondering at the end. The outcome was a little crazy. I feel it could have been a little longer with going further into the other characters back stories. I highly recommend this book, well done. It kept me engrossed to the unexpected end. I predict you will find yourself reading it late into the night, then picking it up the first thing the next morning. Grate story and over good read. Very touching.
