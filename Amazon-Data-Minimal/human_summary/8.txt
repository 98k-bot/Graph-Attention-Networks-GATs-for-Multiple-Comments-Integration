Too many characters and many descriptions on their emotions and thoughts. Characters are flawed, horribly drawn out, unlikable or demonic. Nothing is spectacular and the mind is easy to wander. The story is not fast paced with ridiculous ending, nor a page turner by any stretch of the imagination, predictable and not twisty. There are stirrings of great potential but not executed well. The characterization of this author is way off. The plot is. The writing is full of fluffy, forced adjectives. This is the indicative of lazy and poor research skills. Do not read unless you like the dark side of things or life. It is a waste of time and money. Spare yourself and not recommend.
