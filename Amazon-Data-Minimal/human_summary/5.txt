After reading Amy Harmon What the Wind Knows, I have so many thoughts and feelings. While reading, I think I was a front seat observer in Ireland along the countryside. It is tragic, beautiful and heart wrenching. It is an impossible journey, a travel crossing time that I will never want to forget and leave. The story line totally grabs me. Unlike other historical fiction set in the midst of the Irish revolt against the British, the author blends in history nicely and stay true to facts with depth of love and romance. The story is not dry with no significance. The author provides the reader with two intelligent perspectives and juxtaposes the experience of being in the past to the present. In addition, drawn into the period of Ireland fight for independence, the characters are vividly real with astonishing solidity. Their spirits touch, affect and capture me deeply. Although, the writing is not lyrical and amazing, yet this book is still a delightful read. It is primarily written through the lens of experiences plus the journal entries of an early twentieth century. Anyway, this is a sweet love story with satisfying ending and leaves with possibility of a sequel. The reader can have warm and cozy feeling. I enjoy the book and definitely recommend for five star.
