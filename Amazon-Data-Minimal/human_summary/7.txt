I love every single one of books of this author and this is no exception and I have never been disappointed. The novel is definitely one of author best, however, only uses this topic as a backdrop to the far more engaging subject matter. This novel only use mercy killings as a backdrop to the engaging subject. The true topic is a tender hearted theme weaved with striking metaphors. The author shows a surprising and keen psychological insight into what an obsessive fixation will do to marriage of spouses by the depiction on controversial subjects like euthanasia. The plot examines all aspects of the mercy killing of a wife with end stage metastatic cancer by her husband who can not stand to see her suffer anymore. A love mistake propels the husband to kill his wife by pillow smothering. The neurotic fixation is a less physical but extremely stifling manner. Moral justice is stirred through the pages carefully with right finesse. Characters are of honest and raw emotions. The reader will not be drowned by burden and can feel more than compassion towards characters. The story line challenges you to step into virtual reality to experience someone affair and think about ethical issues when flaws, desires and dreams are exposed. This book is definitely a must read with different situations, perfect ending and lots of twists and turns. I can not put the book down until problems are resolved satisfactory and would like to share it with my daughter, co workers and even a senior citizen. Highly recommend and you will not be disappointed after picking up. It is, from beginning to end, a page turner.
