This novel is authentic and captivating. Every interaction wraps and charms me. The story covers forgiveness in life and the survival of human spirit. The slow pace tends to be overwrought. There is no other issues except expletives. The dialogue is magical. The characters overcome pain from their past. They are real and interesting. The plot is plausible, nicely tied up and twisted with answers and breaks my heart. The subplot with family back story is unnecessary. The beginning is ridiculous and the ending is a little drawn out and abrupt, yet still told well. The writing may be awful to move on. I thoroughly enjoy and laugh out or cry many times. The only regret is that the story is not a little longer. Anyway, a well written novel for you, fantastic and highly recommend with five star.
