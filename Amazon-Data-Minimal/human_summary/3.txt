This is a true story about horrific immigration and being a political refugee, a journey to freedom and democracy. Four kids walked through the Hindu Kush Mountains to escape the oppression. It is unbelievable the trek the author took as a little girl to get out of Russian occupied Afghanistan. The story is also about the courage, patience and strength in the face of desperate odds against suffering and sacrifices. It is also inspiring and heartbreaking for events can be stumbling block or stepping stone. The author transports you to her homeland and sways you to see Afghanistan as a beautiful place before it was torn apart. The country was then overthrown and crushed by horrible events. The author changed her life from the privilege one to another of fighting after the soviet army invaded Afghanistan. Parents have to make tough decisions to stay or flee. The author ultimately reunited with her mother and siblings after all she endured. I wish the author can write a sequel. I would like to know about their emigration to the United States and where the family all settled. This book is a reminder of the human spirit and misery in the world, not just bleakness. Some refugees succeed in surviving without the monetary and human resources. They are strong with contributions and others are not triumphant. Greed and lust for wealth and power will not prevail. It is also a reminder of border security, need for capable workers and struggles in American history for welcoming refugees. The author is sharing Muslim faith and traditions is an education and unforgettable enlightenment. The memoir is well written which is told from the perspective of a young child with great honesty straight from heart. I thoroughly love it and can not put it down. Great book definitely and I highly recommend this autobiography.
