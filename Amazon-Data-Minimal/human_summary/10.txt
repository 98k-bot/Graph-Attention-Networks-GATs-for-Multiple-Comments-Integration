This story does not feel right to me, full of holes and referring too much back without summarizing. The author fails to address the nature of characters and their value as human beings. Love of country is absent in characters, no sense of why they are involved, just a group of indifferent murderers. The story begins with interesting premise, but the author does not focus on the plot and the story is cliched and confusing. Some situations are impractical, messy and preposterous, far to be fetched. Some fight scenes seem scripted from a bad action movie. This book is full of predictable detailed and boring passages and I skimmed some tedious chapters, a condensed version is better.
