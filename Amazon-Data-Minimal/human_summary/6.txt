There is so much hype around the book with little substance. High expectations are not met after reading. The story is a mix of Gone With The Wind and Sparrow but the results are not as good as either of two. So ridiculous. This book is not a reflection of author talent. A poor job of developing terrible female characters has been done. They present to be silly to resolve a bunch of manufactured issues, for example, overbearing beast, petulant woman. When living in the life without true understanding, the default response to most issues is bawling. The flighty Francesca actually can break free from the archaic pressures and upbringing of her parents world. Her cheating and indecision is tiresome. Wolfe is also pretty immature and awful even if he is able to redeem himself. In addition, characters are lack of maturity and naivety through 85 percent of the whole book. Too much time has been spent to explain characters behavior and motives. Descriptive sexual behavior and language in the rape and abusing scene is so disgusting that it ruins the whole book. Such details outweigh the highlight. I feel gross to go through and it is not okay either for a man or a woman. Although the story is well written, yet the there are so many revelations that I want to stop. The story line is potential, especially the interesting premise, but it is not utilized to hold attention. The background is set in modern times, but the plot is full of historical romance with ordinary ending. I do not get the love triangle feel as advertised. There are lots of grammatical errors due to editing such as missing or misspelled words, wrong word forms and confusing sentence structure. It is annoying like an auto correct mistake. This book can be recommended if others will not judge the author by grammar alone. Author other anti heroes books are better than this one. This is my least favorite one.
