In the image , a tiny pair of fur-lined baby booties stands empty between the Southern California couple . `` Coming Soon '' is inscribed above . It is still Ashley 's cover photo .\\n\\nAshley was a mother for only a few short hours before she died . She left behind `` harmonies that will continue to resonate in our hearts and memories , '' her family and friends posted online .\\n\\nLennon James was born by emergency C-section three months early , `` fighting for his life , '' Chris posted . Although Chris was grieving Ashley 's loss , he thanked those who had reached out in several online postings .\\n\\n`` It 's impossible to sum up what has happened in the past couple of days , '' he said . `` My wife , best friend and mother of my child passed away . I have a lifetime to grieve this unspeakable loss , but I know that right now she would want me to focus completely on baby Lennon James Picco ... ''\\n\\nOn Wednesday , a friend posted a video of Chris in the hospital , singing to his newborn son . The video shows Chris seated next to a whirring , clicking incubator , baby Lennon swaddled in blankets and surrounded by tubes . The video was recorded Tuesday , when Chris had posted , `` Ashley would often feel Lennon moving to music , so I brought my guitar today and gave him a little concert . ''\\n\\nThe song Chris chose , `` Blackbird , '' was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney during their time with the Beatles .\\n\\nThe song begins :\\n\\n`` Blackbird singing in the dead of night\\nTake these broken wings and learn to fly\\nAll your life\\nYou were only waiting for this moment to arise . ''\\n\\nLittle Lennon James Pico died late Tuesday night in his father 's arms .\\n\\nOn Wednesday , Chris posted this update :\\n\\n`` Dear friends , family , and supporters ; it is with an unbelievably heavy heart that I write this . My little fighter , Lennon James Picco went to sleep in his daddy 's arms late last night . He was surrounded by family , friends , and the best doctors , nurses and hospital staff in the world . He was dressed in an outfit that Ashley bought for him , with little guitars on it , and wrapped in a blanket made by a dear friend . I am so thankful for the four unforgettable days I got to spend with him . His mommy would have been so beyond joy to see him and to hold him , touch him , bathe him , sing to him - as I have had the privilege of doing . I have been so blessed and honored to love him before he was formed , to cherish him while mommy carried him , meet him face to precious face , and hold his perfect little body while we said ` goodbye for now ' . There are no words , but I wanted to keep you updated , as your love and support has meant more than anything in the world . All you need is love . ''\\n\\nA spokesman for Chris said he wants to tell his story but needed time with family and friends for now . A memorial is planned for Saturday at the Piccos ' church , Loma Linda University Church in Loma Linda , California .\\n\\n\""

In the image , a tiny pair of fur-lined baby booties stands empty between the Southern California couple . `` Coming Soon '' is inscribed above . It is still Ashley 's cover photo .\\n\\nAshley was a mother for only a few short hours before she died . She left behind `` harmonies that will continue to resonate in our hearts and memories , '' her family and friends posted online .\\n\\nLennon James was born by emergency C-section three months early , `` fighting for his life , '' Chris posted . Although Chris was grieving Ashley 's loss , he thanked those who had reached out in several online postings .\\n\\n`` It 's impossible to sum up what has happened in the past couple of days , '' he said . `` My wife , best friend and mother of my child passed away . I have a lifetime to grieve this unspeakable loss , but I know that right now she would want me to focus completely on baby Lennon James Picco ... ''\\n\\nOn Wednesday , a friend posted a video of Chris in the hospital , singing to his newborn son . The video shows Chris seated next to a whirring , clicking incubator , baby Lennon swaddled in blankets and surrounded by tubes . The video was recorded Tuesday , when Chris had posted , `` Ashley would often feel Lennon moving to music , so I brought my guitar today and gave him a little concert . ''\\n\\nThe song Chris chose , `` Blackbird , '' was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney during their time with the Beatles .\\n\\nThe song begins :\\n\\n`` Blackbird singing in the dead of night\\nTake these broken wings and learn to fly\\nAll your life\\nYou were only waiting for this moment to arise . ''\\n\\nLittle Lennon James Pico died late Tuesday night in his father 's arms .\\n\\nOn Wednesday , Chris posted this update :\\n\\n`` Dear friends , family , and supporters ; it is with an unbelievably heavy heart that I write this . My little fighter , Lennon James Picco went to sleep in his daddy 's arms late last night . He was surrounded by family , friends , and the best doctors , nurses and hospital staff in the world . He was dressed in an outfit that Ashley bought for him , with little guitars on it , and wrapped in a blanket made by a dear friend . I am so thankful for the four unforgettable days I got to spend with him . His mommy would have been so beyond joy to see him and to hold him , touch him , bathe him , sing to him - as I have had the privilege of doing . I have been so blessed and honored to love him before he was formed , to cherish him while mommy carried him , meet him face to precious face , and hold his perfect little body while we said ` goodbye for now ' . There are no words , but I wanted to keep you updated , as your love and support has meant more than anything in the world . All you need is love . ''\\n\\nA spokesman for Chris said he wants to tell his story but needed time with family and friends for now . A memorial is planned for Saturday at the Piccos ' church , Loma Linda University Church in Loma Linda , California .\\n\\n\",\n",
              " \"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- International cricketer Steven Davies has received the support of his England colleagues and team bosses after becoming the sport 's first active professional player to announce that he is gay .\\n\\nDavies , a wicketkeeper-batsman with the county Surrey who has played in 13 limited-overs internationals for England , made his revelations in a newspaper interview with The Daily Telegraph published on Monday .\\n\\n`` I feel now is the right time to be open about my sexuality . Those close to me have known for a while and have been nothing but supportive and understanding , '' he told the England Wales and Cricket Board website .\\n\\n`` I 'd like to thank Surrey and the ECB , as well as the England players and coaching staff . They have all offered me their full backing from the moment I told them .\\n\\n`` My focus now is to play the best cricket I can for Surrey and get back into the England side . I am still the same person and I want to be remembered as a good cricketer , not a gay cricketer . ''\\n\\nThe 24-year-old was not selected for the World Cup being played in India , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh , but told coach Andy Flower about his sexuality before the tournament started this month .\\n\\n`` This is something Steve chose to discuss with myself and the squad some time ago . I would like to make it very clear that Steve is first and foremost a very talented cricketer and a valued member of the England set-up , '' Flower said on the ECB website , which also featured a statement from its managing director Hugh Morris .\\n\\nFlower added : `` His private life is his own concern and has absolutely no bearing on his ability to excel at the very highest level in international sport and I have no doubt that he will continue to work hard to regain a place in the England squad .\\n\\n`` Steve has had and will continue to have the full respect and support of the entire squad and everyone involved in England cricket . ''\\n\\nIt is rare for sportspeople to make revelations about their sexuality while still playing , and the closest precedent in cricket was Alan Hansford , a player with English county Sussex who admitted he was gay after retiring in 1992 .\\n\\nDavies told The Daily Telegraph that he had been inspired by the example of Welsh rugby star Gareth Thomas , who revealed his homosexuality two years ago .\\n\\n`` It just showed me it can be done . He was brave enough to stand up and say who he was , '' Davies said .\\n\\n`` It was a very courageous thing to do , so if I can help anyone else like he helped me , then that would be great . ''\\n\\nFormer England international Vikram Solanki , now chairman of his country 's Professional Cricketers ' Association , said Davies ' sexuality was no secret within the cricket community .\\n\\n`` Many of those he plays with and against have known about this for some time , and none of them regard it as anything other than an entirely personal matter , '' Solanki said .\\n\\nDavies also received the backing of openly gay British actor , writer and television presenter Stephen Fry .\\n\\n`` Brave , charming , modest and inspiring . No big deal yet of course a huge deal . Top man Steven Davies , '' Fry wrote on social networking website Twitter .\\n\\nMeanwhile , the West Indies thrashed the Netherlands by 215 runs at the 2011 World Cup in New Delhi on Monday .\\n\\nThe two-time champions bounced back from last week 's defeat by South Africa to get off the mark in Group B , posting a total of 330-8 in 50 overs as Chris Gayle top-scored with 80 and Kieron Pollard smashed 60 off only 27 balls faced .\\n\\nPollard scored the third quickest half-century in the tournament 's history .\\n\\nTeammate Kemar Roach then became only the sixth bowler to take a hat-trick at a World Cup when he polished off the Dutch line-up with three successive wickets to end with figures of 6-27 in an innings of just 115 .\\n\\nIt was a disappointing day for the beaten team , who last week scored 292 before losing against England .\\n\\n\",\n",

It is the ultimate career pinnacle for coaches and players . I want to ensure that we get the tour environment right so that we are hugely competitive and that our fans are proud of their team . ''\\n\\nGatland worked as an assistant coach when the Lions last traveled , which ended with a 2-1 series defeat to South Africa in 2009 .\\n\\nThere will once again be three decisive games against Australia , taking place in Brisbane , Melbourne and Sydney , but the tour will incorporate a total of ten matches in all -- taking in games against regional and clubs sides to warm up for the international tests .\\n\\nAustralia , who have won the World Cup on two occasions -LRB- in 1991 and 1999 -RRB- , are currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind the New Zealand `` All Blacks '' , who won last year 's World Cup on home soil .\\n\\nThe Lions have lost their last three tours to Australia and New Zealand and were last successful there back in 1989 .\\n\\n`` There is no question it will be one hell of a challenge , '' Gatland added .\\n\\n`` Playing in the southern hemisphere is one of rugby 's hardest challenges . ''\\n\\nAfter winning two Six Nations titles with Wales , as well as steering English club side Wasps to European glory , Gatland 's potential role as Lions coach was thrown into doubt when breaking his heels after falling while cleaning windows at his beach house in New Zealand .\\n\\nHe needed reconstructive surgery to repair his right leg , but Lions tour manager Andy Irvine is convinced he will be up to the arduous task .\\n\\n`` It has been no secret that after the initial selection process Warren was our preferred candidate , '' Irvine said .\\n\\n`` However , his unfortunate accident earlier this year in New Zealand during the selection process did delay the appointment . We naturally had to ensure he would be fit to take up the post . Those concerns have now been addressed . ''\\n\\nGatland 's assistant Rob Howley will begin his role as Wales caretaker coach for November 's Tests against Argentina and Samoa , ahead of next year 's Six Nations campaign .\\n\\n\",\n",

Security Council and after France announced it will send 400 additional troops to its former colony .\\n\\nAlready , France , an EU member , has deployed 1,600 personnel there to support African Union troops following a U.N. Security Council vote in December authorizing military intervention .\\n\\nIn late January , the Security Council voted to not only continue its peacekeeping mission in the war-weary African nation but to authorize the use of force by EU troops there -- setting the stage for Friday 's announcement by Ashton .\\n\\nThe Central African Republic plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize , in the latest in a series of coups since the country gained independence in 1960 .\\n\\nRebels infiltrated the capital in March , sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon . One of the Seleka 's leaders , Michel Djotodia , then seized power only to step down as President in January after failing to halt the escalating violence .\\n\\nCatherine Samba-Panza , the mayor of Bangui , was recently tapped as the country 's interim President .\\n\\nStill , the climate is volatile .\\n\\nThe United Nations recently pointed to an `` increasing cycle of violence and retaliation '' and the `` continuing deterioration of the security situation . ''\\n\\nSeleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition , and to counter the attacks on Christian communities , vigilante Christian groups have fought back .\\n\\nThe United Nations -- estimating more than half the country 's population is affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis -- has said it fears genocide brewing .\\n\\nAccording to the United Nations , more than 700,000 people across the Central African Republic have been displaced -- including about 290,000 alone in the capital of Bangui -- and 2.6 million `` need immediate humanitarian assistance . ''\\n\\nAttempts to purge Muslims from parts of the war-torn country have prompted `` a Muslim exodus of historic proportions , '' according to rights group Amnesty International .\\n\\nAnd on Friday , a public prosecutor said that a mass grave with at least 13 decomposing bodies had been discovered in Bangui . Maturin Grenzengue said Central African Republic and allied troops were working to remove concrete slabs of an underground cement tank `` to determine the exact number of bodies that will be found here .

              " \"-LRB- Time.com -RRB- -- Here 's another reason to log off at a reasonable hour : exposure to dim lighting at night -- such as that generated by a TV screen , computer or night-light -- may lead to depressive symptoms , new animal research suggests .\\n\\nA study from Ohio State University Medical Center found that hamsters with chronic exposure to dim light at night showed signs of depression within just a few weeks : reduced physical activity compared with hamsters living in normal light-dark conditions , as well as less interest in sugar water -LRB- a treat for the hamsters -RRB- , greater signs of distress when placed in water , and changes in the brain 's hippocampus that are similar to brain changes seen in depressed people .\\n\\n`` The results we found in hamsters are consistent with what we know about depression in humans , '' Tracy Bedrosian , the first author the on the new study , told reporters .\\n\\nTime.com : TV , video games at night may cause sleep problems in kids\\n\\nMood disorders are by no means the only health condition linked to artificial lighting and screen time at night . Earlier this year , the American Medical Association -LRB- AMA -RRB- put out a disturbing summary of adverse health effects from nighttime lighting , noting that artificial lights disrupt circadian rhythms and alter the body 's normal hormonal responses .\\n\\nIn particular , when people spend too little time in darkness , it seems that the body suppresses release of the hormone melatonin , which -- among other things -- is thought to fight tumor growth and cancers . Other health conditions affected by changes in circadian rhythms , according to the AMA report , may include obesity , diabetes and reproductive problems .\\n\\n`` The good news is that people who stay up late in front of the television and computer may be able to undo some of the harmful effects just by going back to a regular light-dark cycle and minimizing their exposure to artificial light at night , '' Bedrosian says . `` That 's what the results we found in hamsters would suggest . ''\\n\\nThose animals ' depressive symptoms , at least , went away once the hamsters returned to a schedule that included eight full hours of total darkness per day .\\n\\nTime.com : 5 ways to survive daylight saving time\\n\\nBedrosian and her colleagues say that , among humans , exposure to artificial lighting at night has surged over the past 50 years , a trend that happens to coincide with large increases in depression prevalence .\\n\\nLight pollution can come from TV and computer screens , other electronic displays and ambient sources such as streetlights , passing traffic and neighboring buildings , in addition to overhead lighting within the home .\\n\\nFor their study , the Ohio State researchers also investigated molecular mechanisms that may cause the brain changes associated with nighttime lighting . The scientists found that a cell-signaling protein , or cytokine , known as a hippocampal TNF -LRB- tumor necrosis factor -RRB- played a limited role .\\n\\nThey demonstrated that by inhibiting TNF signaling , some of the depressive effects of light at night could be reversed in the hamsters .

              " \"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You know that a news story has broken through , as we like to say in the journalism business , when Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart start playing it for laughs . In the last few weeks , the dynamic duo of Comedy Central has had a field day with the subject of super PACs , those fundraising machines that can raise unlimited donations to fund political ads , provided that they are not officially affiliated with a specific candidate .\\n\\nWhen Colbert launched his mock run for `` President of the United States of South Carolina , '' Stewart came on his show to announce that he would head up the `` Definitely Not Coordinated with Stephen Colbert Super PAC , '' swearing that it would have no ties to the friend whose hand he was holding on the set .\\n\\nIt 's become an easy talking point that this will be the most expensive presidential race in history , and that super PACs could tip the outcome . But in a special In Depth series of reports , CNN will take a hard look at that conventional wisdom -- exploring what super PACs are , what they do , who funds them , and how much power they really have . These special reports will air daily this week across all our prime-time and daytime television shows -- including `` The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer , '' `` John King , USA , '' `` Anderson Cooper 360Ëš , '' `` Piers Morgan Tonight '' and `` Erin Burnett OutFront '' -- and across all our digital platforms .\\n\\nSuper PACs vs. the little guy : Why do you donate ?\\n\\nWe will go behind the scenes at American Crossroads , Karl Rove 's conservative PAC that helped launched the trend -LRB- and the conspiracy theories -RRB- . We 'll profile Sheldon Adelson , the Las Vegas billionaire who wrote a $ 5 million check to a PAC that waged a nasty air war against Mitt Romney in South Carolina , helping to pave the way for Newt Gingrich 's stunning primary victory on Saturday . We 'll air an investigation into how super PACs have outmaneuvered a bewildering obstacle course of campaign finance regulations , and given rise to calls for a whole new maze of do 's and do n'ts .\\n\\nAt the same time , we 'll try to put some much-needed context around a subject that has become grist for knee-jerk partisan rhetoric . We 'll report on how Democrats -- Definitely Not Coordinated with President Barack Obama ! -- are also playing the super PAC game . -LRB- We 'll also profile some `` heavy hitters '' who will be openly supporting the president in 2012 and others who have turned their back on him since 2008 . -RRB-\\n\\nWe 'll analyze the controversial `` Citizens United '' ruling by the Supreme Court that sanctioned unlimited corporate and union donations to nonaffiliated PACs , showing how it eliminated some troublesome inequities in the previous financing rules while adding new complexities . We will also look at how much money you need nowadays to run for office at the local , congressional and Senate levels , and at how much politicians stand to make personally while in office and once they leave .\\n\\nAs CNN 's team of political reporters and analysts decamps from South Carolina to cover the Florida primary this week , they will assess the impact that money has -- and has n't -- had in this electoral cycle so far . How much did it determine who threw their hat into the Republican ring in the first place and who stayed away ? How different would things be now if Romney and the -LRB- definitely not coordinated -RRB- PAC run by his former aides had n't had millions to savage Gingrich with negatives ads in Iowa , or if Adelson had n't put up his $ 5 million to tear down Romney in South Carolina ? And could money help alter the dynamic of the GOP primary contest yet again in Florida , given the staggering costs of organizing across such a large state and buying political ads in so many expensive local media markets ?\\n\\nFor all the hyperventilation about super PACs , we 'll also examine all the ways in which the narrative of this campaign shows that money still is n't everything in politics : the flameout of Rick Perry 's deep-pocketed campaign , the staying power of Ron Paul 's grass-roots movement , the number of times that the `` free media '' of press coverage have shifted the momentum overnight , from the latest debate to the personal scandal du jour .\\n\\nAnd on CNN.com , we will solicit iReport videos from scores of ordinary citizens across America who have donated $ 50 or less to a political campaign this year and who want to deliver a simple message : This is what I want for my money ! For here at CNN , our aim is n't to take sides or tell you what to think . It 's to give you the news and knowledge you need to make up your own mind -- and the confidence to make your own voice heard .\\n\\n\",\n",
              " \"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Canadian government hopes to overturn a decision granting refugee status to a white South African who says he would face persecution at home , a spokesman for Canada 's immigration minister said Friday .\\n\\nThe Immigration and Refugee Board recently granted refugee status to Brandon Huntley , 31 , a South African native who has been living illegally in Canada .\\n\\nThe board decided to let him live and work legally in Canada after Huntley argued he had been the victim of racial violence and discrimination in South Africa . The board operates independently of the Canadian government .\\n\\nThe ruling African National Congress in South Africa blasted the decision as racist and said it would `` only serve to perpetuate racism . '' Watch how the South African government has condemned the ruling ''\\n\\nNow the Canadian government plans to ask federal courts to overturn the decision , said Alykhan Velshi , a spokesman for Canadian Immigration Minister Jason Kenney .\\n\\n`` It 's important to stress that this is n't the minister 's decision nor that of the government , '' Velshi said in a statement Friday . `` It was a decision taken by the quasi-judicial , independent Immigration and Refugee Board . I will leave it to them to defend the quality of their decisions . ''\\n\\nHe declined further comment `` because the matter is now before the courts . ''\\n\\nA spokesman for the Immigration and Refugee Board earlier also had declined to comment on the grounds that refugee claims are confidential .\\n\\nHowever , a member of the board 's Refugee Protection Division , William Davis , has written in The Toronto Star that the board found that Huntley 's case demonstrated `` a picture of indifference and inability or unwillingness '' by South Africa to protect `` white South Africans from persecution by African South Africans . ''\\n\\nAbout 79 percent of South Africans are black ; 9.6 percent are white .\\n\\nHuntley 's attorney , Russell Kaplan , said his client had been attacked seven times by black South Africans who called him a `` settler '' and a `` white dog . ''\\n\\n`` In each instance , there were racially motivated remarks that were made -- that 's what distinguishes this case from ordinary criminality , '' Kaplan said .\\n\\nThe African National Congress has a different view .\\n\\n`` We find the claim by Huntley to have been attacked seven times by Africans due to his skin color -- without any police intervention -- sensational and alarming , '' the ANC said in a statement this week .\\n\\nKaplan is a human rights lawyer in Canada who left South Africa 20 years ago to escape the apartheid government 's discrimination against black South Africans .\\n\\n`` Twenty years later , we have this case that involves the exact opposite , '' he said this week .\\n\\nNewspaper clippings were presented as evidence of life in South Africa during the August 18 hearing , South Africa 's The Times reported .\\n\\nKaplan 's sister , who came to Canada last year , testified about `` the torture and murder '' of their brother , who was killed by robbers in 1997 , the newspaper reported .\\n\\nThe ANC said the current government under President Jacob Zuma is committed to fighting crime `` regardless of color or creed . ''\\n\\nThe South African government would have preferred Canada seek its view `` before such a decision was made , '' South African Foreign Affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa told The Times .\\n\\n`` Quite clearly , the allegations are as preposterous as they are laughable -- which they would be if they were not serious , '' he told the newspaper .\\n\\n\",\n",

              " \"Data from communications between satellites and missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was released Tuesday , more than two months after relatives of passengers say they requested that it be made public .\\n\\nBut criticism quickly emerged suggesting that the information provided lacks important elements that would help outside experts put the official version of events to the test .\\n\\nMalaysian authorities published a 47-page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the jetliner and the British company Inmarsat 's satellite system .\\n\\nThe information provided is n't the whole picture but is `` intended to provide a readable summary of the data communication logs , '' the notes at the beginning of the document say .\\n\\nIn the weeks following the plane 's March 8 disappearance , a team of international experts used the satellite data and other information , including radar data and engine performance calculations , to conclude that the aircraft ended up in a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean .\\n\\nSome passengers ' families , unsatisfied by the official explanation of the plane 's fate , say they want an independent analysis of the complex information , a process that could take some time .\\n\\nMichael Exner , one of the most vocal experts among those calling for the release of the data , said a very preliminary review suggested that there were gaps in the notes explaining the data .\\n\\nThe explanatory notes at the start of the document `` answer a few of the questions we have had , but leave many questions unanswered , '' he told CNN .\\n\\nCNN safety analyst David Soucie said certain key elements , which would allow independent experts to fully test the official conclusion , are missing from the data in the document .\\n\\n`` There 's not enough information to say whether they made an error , '' he said . `` I think we 're still going to be looking for more . ''\\n\\nInmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce acknowledged Tuesday that the company did n't release the model to which it applied the data to estimate the plane 's path -- and said the decision on whether to release the model lies with the Malaysian government , which is leading the search .\\n\\n`` We 'd be perfectly happy to put that model out , '' Pearce told CNN 's `` New Day . ''\\n\\nBut Pearce also told CNN that the released data is enough -- along with engine and radar data -- for experienced third parties to plug into their own models and reach their own conclusions .\\n\\n`` You should n't read anything into any gaps in the data , '' Inmarsat Senior Vice President Chris McLaughlin told CNN 's `` Erin Burnett OutFront '' on Tuesday . `` This is a very goodwill and focused way that we 're trying to communicate our best impression of what happened . ''\\n\\nSarah Bajc , whose partner , Philip Wood , was on the missing jet , said she was `` annoyed '' that Inmarsat and Malaysian authorities had n't released everything they used to reach their conclusions .\\n\\n`` I see no reason for them to have massaged this before giving it to us , '' she said .\\n\\nIs Inmarsat right ?\\n\\nData guided search\\n\\nFor weeks , Inmarsat said it did n't have the authority to release the data , deferring to Malaysian authorities , who are in charge of the search for the plane that disappeared over Southeast Asia while on a scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing .\\n\\nLast week , the two sides announced that they would aim to make the information available to the public .\\n\\nThe satellite signals -- called `` handshakes '' -- with MH370 were part of a larger set of data that investigators have used to try to establish the whereabouts of the missing Boeing 777 with 239 people on board .\\n\\nThe handshakes continued to take place for roughly six hours after the aircraft dropped off radar screens .\\n\\nMonths of searching by dozens of planes and ships in the southern Indian Ocean has so far turned up no wreckage , and investigators have not been able to say for sure where the remains of MH370 might be .\\n\\nThe underwater search for the missing plane will effectively be put on hold this week , and may not resume until August at the earliest , according to Australia 's top transport safety official .\\n\\nAnalysts have said the release of the satellite data could help discount some theories about what happened to the jetliner , and potentially fuel new ones .\\n\\nRelatives of people who were on the passenger jet , scientists studying its disappearance and media covering the search have become increasingly critical about the lack of public information about why the search has focused on the southern Indian Ocean .\\n\\n`` I think far too much has been left to experts who have remained behind the curtain , '' said K.S. Narendran , whose wife , Chandrika Sharma , was on the flight .\\n\\nInmarsat confident\\n\\nEven though more than 80 days have passed without searchers finding any wreckage from the plane , Inmarsat officials say they remain confident in their data .\\n\\n`` Yes , to a high degree of probability , we are certain that our data is right , '' McLaughlin said Tuesday .\\n\\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN 's Richard Quest last week , Inmarsat 's vice president of satellite operations said the company 's calculations have been tested by other people .\\n\\n`` No one has come up yet with a reason why it should n't work with this particular flight when it has worked with others , '' Mark Dickinson said . `` And it 's very important this is n't just an Inmarsat activity . There are other people doing investigations , experts who are helping the investigation team , who have got the same data , who made their own models up and did the same thing to see if they got the same results and broadly speaking , they got roughly the same answers . ''\\n\\nExperts came to the conclusion that the plane had ended up in the southern Indian Ocean by piecing together three types of information , he said .\\n\\n`` We have actually the messages from the ground station to the plane and back again . That essentially tells you the terminal is switched on and powered up . We have some timing information and in addition to that there were some frequency measurements , '' he said .\\n\\nThe timings told them the distance between the plane and the satellite , enabling them to map out arcs . Then they factored in frequency differences , determining that the plane had headed south .\\n\\n` The right work '\\n\\nIt was a startling conclusion -- and Dickinson says investigators made sure to repeatedly check their calculations before sharing them .\\n\\n`` You want to make sure when you come to a conclusion like that , that you 've done the right work , the data is as you understand it to be , '' he said .\\n\\nNow , Dickinson says he 's well aware that the entire weight of the search rests on the Inmarsat data .\\n\\n`` This is all the data we have for what has happened for those six or so hours , '' he said . `` It 's important we all get it right and particularly that everyone looking at the data makes the best judgments on it and how it 's used . And particularly for the families and friends of the relatives on board , try and make sure that we can help bring this sad incident to a close . ''\\n\\nQuest said he thinks the expertise of the Inmarsat team and the level of testing to which their work was subjected justifies their confidence in their conclusions .\\n\\n`` It is up to the detractors and doubters to come up and say why they believe it 's wrong , '' he said . `` Not the other way around . ''\\n\\nBajc acknowledged that independent analysis of the data may support Inmarsat 's conclusions .\\n\\n`` That would be a fine outcome as far as I 'm concerned , '' she said .\\n\\nBut if the independent experts come up with alternative flight paths based on the data , Bajc said , then `` those need to be investigated . ''\\n\\nThe wait for data\\n\\nThe issue of making the satellite data public has become the cause of confusion and contradictory statements .\\n\\nBajc said the families had first asked for the data more than two months ago .\\n\\n`` It seemed a relatively innocent request '' at the time , she said , but authorities refused to release it .\\n\\nMalaysian officials told CNN earlier this month that their government did not have the data . But Inmarsat officials said the company provided all of it to Malaysian officials `` at an early stage in the search . ''\\n\\n`` We 've shared the information that we had , and it 's for the investigation to decide what and when it puts out , '' McLaughlin said earlier this month .\\n\\nBut a senior Malaysian official told CNN that the government needed Inmarsat 's help to pass on the data to families `` in a presentable way . ''\\n\\n`` We are trying to be as transparent as possible , '' the official said . `` We have no issues releasing the data . ''\\n\\nBajc said the delay only added to questions surrounding the information .\\n\\n`` It 's a little curious to me why this had to become such a big deal , '' she said Tuesday .\\n\\nDid Inmarsat data point Flight 370 searchers in wrong direction ?\\n\\nCannes : Movie maker courts controversy with MH370 thriller\\n\\n\",\n",
              " \"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The announcement by the U.S. Census Bureau that the population stood at 308,745,538 on April 1 is a number for which many people have been waiting .\\n\\nNevada , Arizona , Utah and Idaho had the fastest growth this decade while slow growth was seen in Rhode Island , Louisiana , Ohio and New York . Michigan was the only state to see a decline .\\n\\nMost people poring over the 2010 state counts are doing so with an eye to future elections , but it makes sense to proceed cautiously before drawing any hard conclusions about what that data mean in the political context .\\n\\nAttention is focused on 12 seats in the House of Representatives that will be leaving slow-growth states in the Northeast and Midwest and moving to the South and Southwest as populations there continued to grow quickly .\\n\\nCensus 2010 : America grew at slowest rate since the Depression\\n\\nTexas is the big winner , with four new House seats . Since the states losing seats are usually regarded as blue , tending to elect Democrats , and those gaining seats are normally considered red , tending to elect Republicans , it would be easy to assume Tuesday 's census release is good news for that party and alarming news for Democrats .\\n\\nIt 's not that simple .\\n\\nIf we regard simple population change as an indicator of political power , the buildup in red states is indeed significant . However , early next year , the Census Bureau will release counts of the population by race and ethnicity . That number will show shifts of the population that official estimates have pointed to all along : The diversifying of the population is more extensive in areas of fast population growth .\\n\\nMany of the states that have gained in their head count have gained non-white minorities , especially Hispanics . Estimates already show that four states that gained seats -- Texas , Florida , Arizona and Georgia -- are highly ranked in the Top 10 states for growth in the Hispanic population during this decade .\\n\\nMoreover , more than half the population growth in those states alone came from increases in the Latino population . These additions were a result of net immigration and births in those states . While the large increase in Hispanics in these high-growth states includes some immigrant newcomers ineligible to vote , eligible Latinos tend to vote Democratic in most of the states that gained seats . That may change by 2012 , but much will happen between now and then .\\n\\nPutting this into further perspective , the U.S. population grew by 9.7 % between 2000 and 2010 , slower than any decade since the Great Depression in the 1930s . With the Great Recession taking hold at the end of the 2000s , slowing immigration and birth rates , it is possible that slower growth will continue , at least for the short term . Thus , the sizeable increase in minority populations comes at a time when the overall population is growing more slowly .\\n\\nThus the sweeping demographic changes going on in our nation are much more significant than just shifts in where people live . We are becoming more diverse , and , as many analysts have noted , we will be a white-minority nation in about 30 years . So simply looking at geography may not yield correct results when we 're talking about how new populations may behave and particularly how they may vote .\\n\\nThe excitement that demographers feel about this once-a-decade population snapshot is likely overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of political analysts , who are busy discovering what state-level population shifts mean for state reapportionment and redistricting within states .\\n\\nBut as we can see by looking more carefully at the data , there is more to population shifts than a simple rearranging of the map based on total counts .\\n\\nWe 're in for a much more interesting and challenging time than many people may believe .\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Audrey Singer .\\n\\n\"]"
